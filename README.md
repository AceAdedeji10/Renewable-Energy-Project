Certainly! Below is the **README.md** documentation for the **Python project** focusing on renewable energy analysis, which you can use for your GitHub repository. This will provide clear instructions on how to run the Python code, the project's purpose, and the methodology.



# Renewable Energy Analysis - Python Project

## Project Overview

This project performs an **in-depth analysis** of renewable energy projects, with a focus on understanding **energy production**, **job creation**, and **greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions**. The goal is to explore the relationship between renewable energy variables (such as installed capacity, energy production, storage efficiency, and financial incentives) and their impacts on the environment and economy.

The analysis uses various **machine learning models** to predict energy production and consumption, and identifies key variables influencing job creation and GHG emission reductions.

### **Key Insights**:
- Analyzes the relationship between **installed capacity** and **energy production**.
- Investigates the effect of **grid integration** and **storage efficiency** on energy production and consumption.
- Evaluates the performance of predictive models (e.g., linear regression and Random Forest).
- Examines how different renewable energy types impact **job creation** and **GHG reductions**.

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Python Code:

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - The dataset (`energy_dataset_.csv`) is used for analysis and is located in the project folder.
   - Make sure the dataset is correctly loaded before proceeding with any analysis.

2. **Run the Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, which involves handling missing data, detecting and removing outliers, and transforming variables as needed.
   
3. **Create Visualizations**:
   - Several visualizations, such as **scatter plots**, **box plots**, and **bar charts**, are generated to help understand relationships between energy production and other variables.

4. **Build Predictive Models**:
   - **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models are created to predict **energy production** and **energy consumption** based on different variables.
   - Evaluate the models using **R-squared** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

5. **Interpret Results**:
   - The models' performance is analyzed, and insights are drawn from the **feature importance analysis**, identifying the most influential variables.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values were handled by removing rows with **null values**.
   - Outliers were detected and excluded to ensure the model's robustness.
   - **Standardization** was applied to variables such as **energy production** and **consumption** for consistency.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized relationships between **installed capacity** and **energy production** using **scatter plots**.
   - Explored the effect of **grid integration** on energy production using **box plots** and **bar charts**.

### 3. **Modeling**:
   - **Linear Regression** was applied to predict **energy production** based on variables like **installed capacity**, **grid integration**, and **storage efficiency**.
   - **Random Forest Regressor** was used as an ensemble learning method to capture non-linear relationships between features and energy production.

### 4. **Feature Importance**:
   - The **Random Forest model** helped determine which features were most influential in predicting **energy production**, with **installed capacity** identified as the top feature.

### 5. **Job Creation and GHG Emission Reduction**:
   - Analyzed the correlation between **job creation** and **GHG reduction**, showing a positive relationship between these factors.
   - **Solar** and **wind** projects were found to create the most jobs and reduce the most **GHG emissions**.

---

## Results

- **Energy Production vs Installed Capacity**: The analysis found a **weak correlation** between installed capacity and energy production, suggesting that other factors (like grid integration or energy storage) play a significant role.
- **Job Creation**: **Solar** and **wind** energy projects were identified as the largest job creators, mainly due to the labor-intensive nature of their installation and maintenance.
- **Predictive Model Performance**: Both the **linear regression** and **Random Forest** models showed poor predictive performance (low R-squared values), indicating that more complex features or models may be needed for better predictions.
- **GHG Emission Reduction**: There is a moderate positive correlation between **job creation** and **GHG emission reduction**, meaning renewable energy projects that create jobs are likely to also contribute to environmental sustainability.
